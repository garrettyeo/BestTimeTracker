# My Personal Project: BestTimeTracker

## Best Time Tracker for Swimming Application

This application will be similar to the different online timing and ranking services found on the *FINA*, *Swimming 
Canada*, and *USA Swimming* websites. This application will allow people to record their times for different swimming 
events, along with other necessary information like name, age, and swimmer group. After recording their times, people 
will be able to determine their own personal best times, as well as compare times across similar age and swimmer groups 
for each event.

This application is designed for use by competitive swimmers. As a former competitive swimmer, myself, I used to 
frequently document sets from my training sessions, and the times I swam both in practice and during swim meets to 
track my performance relative to my goal times. This application will make it easier to record times for personal use.
